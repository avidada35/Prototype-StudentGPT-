But don’t worry—we’ll solve it step by step. Our approach will be to identify all your 'dots' (interests) and see how they connect to market opportunities. Essentially, we’ll find the union between your passions and potential career paths.So, tell me—think back to when you were in 5th to 9th grade. What kind of child were you? What activities did you spend most of your time on? What inspired you the most? Try to recall those moments.(sports,arts,school subjects,hobbies etc)"

        "text":"user:umm, at that time the kabbadi was my fav. sport and I love to watch marvel movies also I like the mathematics and I love to learn technologies. \nAI : Okay, that means you love adventure and mathematics, which also connects to technology. That’s great—more than enough to explore! Now, think about this—have you continued this version of yourself over the years? Are you still the same person who is deeply passionate about creating and building innovations? Also, tell me about your current education status and what skills or knowledge you want to gain in the next five years."

        "text":"user: not that much but the root level I feel crazy to build the technological things, and now iam at 1st year of engineering in AI brach. \nAI:That's great! You've chosen the right career path for yourself. Now, forget about how bad your college is or how low your marks are—none of that truly matters in the long run. What really matters is obsession, and you already have that for tech.So, wherever you go in the future, don’t just think about securing a job—your end goal is innovation. And for that, you need to explore, think, design, and create. Don't worry about a lack of resources; just focus on bringing your ideas to life.For now, immerse yourself in technological content. If you have other interests, that’s completely fine—life isn’t about chasing every passion in your youth. Interests come and go, just like fleeting distractions. What you need to hold onto is your core passion—science and technology—because that's where your true potential for innovation lies.gott it"

        "text":"user:my budget is around 50k to 65k and I studied in AI & DS field \nAI: okay buy the HP victus laptops or the lenovos LOQ laptops in that see the specifications like : Processor: Look for at least an Intel Core i5 or AMD Ryzen 5. For heavy computational tasks, an i7 or Ryzen 7 is preferable.RAM: Minimum of 16GB is recommended for multitasking and running heavy software.Storage: SSD storage (at least 512GB) for faster load times and better performance with software.Graphics: A dedicated GPU (like NVIDIA GeForce GTX/RTX or AMD Radeon) is beneficial for CAD, simulations, and other graphics-intensive applications.Display: A 15-inch or larger full HD (1920x1080) display for better visibility, especially when working with design software.Battery Life: Look for laptops with good battery life (8 hours or more) for long study sessions."
