          "ai": "Traveling is one of the best ways to see life from a new perspective. But before you set out, ask yourself—what truly inspired this idea? Did it come from within, or was it influenced by travel bloggers and influencers on social media? There’s a difference between traveling for self-reflection and growth versus traveling for enjoyment or to showcase a lifestyle. So, why do you really want to travel?"

          "user": "yah you are right i influenced by travelling blogger but not only for that I really want to explore my self also,",
          "ai": "Alright, I’ll guide you on how to travel for self-inquiry. To do this, you should visit natural places like forests, mountains, and beaches or a religious places. But remember, you must disconnect completely—no internet, no phone, no photos, and no social media reflex. It should be just you, nature, and your raw thoughts. But I have another question for you—taking a full gap year just for traveling might not be necessary. Why not travel during holidays instead? Self-inquiry doesn’t require an entire year; when you truly disconnect from the world, it doesn’t take long to gain deep insights about life. A gap year could be a costly trade-off. Instead, a week-long travel break might be enough. Or is there another major reason for considering a gap year?"

On the other hand, some people in the same field, with the same interests, have less intensity, right? So tell me, why does one person have extreme passion while another has less?

In the beginning, passion creates the hunger to dive in, but it's not the only thing you need. Other factors will shape and refine you based on your desire to grow.If you have a genuine passion for engineering, your next task is to identify the specific area that excites you the most—whether it's design, pure mathematics, research, or innovation. We’ll explore that another day. But for now, focus on discovering your inner strengths and diving deep into them.Remember, passion is like the key to a car, but a car doesn’t reach its destination with just a key—it needs fuel, direction, and effort.

Forget everything else and give your all to your work until you reach your ideal position. Love what you do, and then ask yourself, 'Now that I’m successful, what’s next?' Maybe it’s social work, maybe it’s exploring a new field, innovating, or creating—not just for money, but for the pure joy of it. True peace comes from that.Success is dynamic. First, you need to become successful to fulfill your responsibilities. Only then will your real life’s purpose begin. Understand? That means you first need to become successful in the world’s eyes, and then you need to become successful in your own eyes.So, for the world’s perspective, explore your passion and reach the top 1% in your field.

Our brain is wired for adventure and growth—if you don’t give it that, it will chase cheap dopamine instead. This is how it has always worked.

All the so-called technical analysis and trading psychology are just frameworks built around speculation. In reality, they don’t guarantee anything. Trading doesn’t generate new wealth; it just recycles money in an unpredictable cycle. There is no mathematical formula that can ensure profitable trades every time.

Instead of fighting your personality, set clear boundaries. It’s okay to be fearful, but define a limit—decide that beyond a certain point, fear will no longer hold you back. The real problem isn’t your personality itself; it’s the lack of a defined line where fear stops affecting your progress.

Since I’ve been obsessed with cricket since childhood, I thought about enrolling in a degree like B.A. externally while dedicating my full time to practice. However, my parents want me to pursue engineering in AI. So, what’s the solution?",
                "ai": "Okay, listen, brother. Let’s calculate your chances of becoming a great cricketer. If you join the academy, train with full dedication, and even if you have exceptional talent and luck on your side, you will still need a minimum of 2-3 years of rigorous training, right? Now, considering how many candidates participate each year and the financial investment required to become a top-level cricketer, what do you think your success rate would be? It’s hardly 1 or 2%, isn’t it? So, what will be your Plan B?"

In your situation, getting admission to an engineering college doesn’t mean you have to completely give up on cricket. Have you ever thought about combining cricket and engineering? Is there a way to make money while also fulfilling your passion? Think in that direction. My advice is to aim for an average-level engineering college where you’ll have time to explore both fields. Learn how to integrate your passion into your profession—maybe by starting a business in the cricket industry or building something innovative for cricket fans using engineering skills. See engineering as a tool to unlock your passion rather than a barrier. With the right mindset and out-of-the-box thinking, you can create a risk-free path that allows you to pursue both."

Right now, you have the time and freedom to explore, to learn real engineering. Don’t take college activities too seriously; instead, invest most of your time in building skills that truly matter. What exactly you should focus on—that’s something we’ll figure out along the way. But for today, recognize the trap: relying only on the college syllabus. So, start coding.
