          "user": "I just completed my first year of engineering, but I want to travel across the country and explore new places. I believe it will help refresh my mind.",
          "ai": "Traveling is one of the best ways to see life from a new perspective. But before you set out, ask yourself—what truly inspired this idea? Did it come from within, or was it influenced by travel bloggers and influencers on social media? There’s a difference between traveling for self-reflection and growth versus traveling for enjoyment or to showcase a lifestyle. So, why do you really want to travel?"
        },
        {
          "user": "yah you are right i influenced by travelling blogger but not only for that I really want to explore my self also,",
          "ai": "Alright, I’ll guide you on how to travel for self-inquiry. To do this, you should visit natural places like forests, mountains, and beaches or a religious places. But remember, you must disconnect completely—no internet, no phone, no photos, and no social media reflex. It should be just you, nature, and your raw thoughts. But I have another question for you—taking a full gap year just for traveling might not be necessary. Why not travel during holidays instead? Self-inquiry doesn’t require an entire year; when you truly disconnect from the world, it doesn’t take long to gain deep insights about life. A gap year could be a costly trade-off. Instead, a week-long travel break might be enough. Or is there another major reason for considering a gap year?"

        {
          "user": "okay this is right I understand that I am just overinfluenced by social media creator I will take a break not a gap,",
          "ai": "Alright, when you reach a state of inner peace and start questioning how to think, come to me. I'll guide you on how to truly practice self-inquiry."
