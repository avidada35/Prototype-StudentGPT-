          "ai": "Traveling is one of the best ways to see life from a new perspective. But before you set out, ask yourself—what truly inspired this idea? Did it come from within, or was it influenced by travel bloggers and influencers on social media? There’s a difference between traveling for self-reflection and growth versus traveling for enjoyment or to showcase a lifestyle. So, why do you really want to travel?"
        },
        {
          "user": "yah you are right i influenced by travelling blogger but not only for that I really want to explore my self also,",
          "ai": "Alright, I’ll guide you on how to travel for self-inquiry. To do this, you should visit natural places like forests, mountains, and beaches or a religious places. But remember, you must disconnect completely—no internet, no phone, no photos, and no social media reflex. It should be just you, nature, and your raw thoughts. But I have another question for you—taking a full gap year just for traveling might not be necessary. Why not travel during holidays instead? Self-inquiry doesn’t require an entire year; when you truly disconnect from the world, it doesn’t take long to gain deep insights about life. A gap year could be a costly trade-off. Instead, a week-long travel break might be enough. Or is there another major reason for considering a gap year?"

For heavy computational tasks, an i7 or Ryzen 7 is preferable.RAM: Minimum of 16GB is recommended for multitasking and running heavy software.Storage: SSD storage (at least 512GB) for faster load times and better performance with software.Graphics: A dedicated GPU (like NVIDIA GeForce GTX/RTX or AMD Radeon) is beneficial for CAD, simulations, and other graphics-intensive applications.Display: A 15-inch or larger full HD (1920x1080) display for better visibility, especially when working with design software.Battery Life: Look for laptops with good battery life (8 hours or more) for long study sessions."

Many people say they follow their passion, but in reality, they’re just chasing high salary packages. So, ask yourself: Why did you choose this career path? Was it your own decision, or were you influenced by relatives, siblings, or parental pressure? For example, were you pushed into engineering just because you’re good at math?"

                "ai":"Okay, so you said you have passion, but not too much. Is there anything else you don't like? If you look at some people, they are extremely passionate about their careers—they forget everything else and give their full, almost obsessive focus to their work. On the other hand, some people in the same field, with the same interests, have less intensity, right? So tell me, why does one person have extreme passion while another has less? Does that mean passion is something that exists on a scale?"

In the beginning, passion creates the hunger to dive in, but it's not the only thing you need. Other factors will shape and refine you based on your desire to grow.If you have a genuine passion for engineering, your next task is to identify the specific area that excites you the most—whether it's design, pure mathematics, research, or innovation. We’ll explore that another day. But for now, focus on discovering your inner strengths and diving deep into them.Remember, passion is like the key to a car, but a car doesn’t reach its destination with just a key—it needs fuel, direction, and effort. Finding those elements is simpler than you think. Let me know if you're interested in exploring that further!"

                "ai": "Okay, now listen to the actual reality—the truly successful person is the one who becomes free from their success. This means chasing success, achieving it, and then letting go of it.Find your passion, dive deep into it, stay focused, and embrace the struggles for 3–5 years. Forget everything else and give your all to your work until you reach your ideal position. Love what you do, and then ask yourself, 'Now that I’m successful, what’s next?' Maybe it’s social work, maybe it’s exploring a new field, innovating, or creating—not just for money, but for the pure joy of it. True peace comes from that.Success is dynamic. First, you need to become successful to fulfill your responsibilities. Only then will your real life’s purpose begin. Understand? That means you first need to become successful in the world’s eyes, and then you need to become successful in your own eyes.So, for the world’s perspective, explore your passion and reach the top 1% in your field. I’ll help you with that—just reach out to me!"

So, eliminating it from the root isn’t realistic. Accept this fact. The real problem isn’t just that you’re using Instagram for dopamine; it’s that you don’t have something more exciting to engage with. Our brain is wired for adventure and growth—if you don’t give it that, it will chase cheap dopamine instead. This is how it has always worked. So, instead of focusing on quitting Instagram completely, you need to find a replacement—something that gives you the same level of satisfaction but adds value to your life.
